Kidney stones are painful, but often preventable. Here are practical tips to reduce your risk:

- **Stay hydrated:** Drink at least 2–3 liters of water daily. Clear urine is a good sign.
- **Limit salt and animal protein:** Excess salt and red meat can increase stone formation.
- **Eat calcium-rich foods:** Contrary to myth, dietary calcium helps prevent stones.
- **Avoid oxalate-heavy foods in excess:** Spinach, nuts, and chocolate can contribute to stone formation.
- **Don’t ignore symptoms:** Pain in the side, blood in urine, or frequent UTIs may signal stones.

If you’ve had stones before, regular checkups and imaging can help prevent recurrence.
