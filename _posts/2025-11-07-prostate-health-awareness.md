The prostate is a small gland with a big impact on men’s health. As men age, it’s common for the prostate to enlarge — a condition called BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia).

**Watch for these signs:**
- Frequent urination, especially at night
- Weak urine stream or difficulty starting
- Feeling of incomplete emptying

**What you can do:**
- Get a prostate check-up after age 50
- Maintain a healthy weight and diet
- Avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol
- Don’t delay treatment — early care prevents complications

Prostate cancer is also a concern, but early detection saves lives. Talk to your urologist about screening options.
