UTIs are common — especially in women — and can affect the bladder, kidneys, or urethra.

**Symptoms include:**
- Burning sensation while urinating
- Frequent urge to urinate
- Cloudy or foul-smelling urine
- Lower abdominal pain

**Causes:**
- Poor hygiene
- Holding urine too long
- Dehydration
- Sexual activity

**Prevention tips:**
- Drink plenty of water
- Don’t hold urine unnecessarily
- Wipe front to back (for women)
- Urinate after intercourse

If left untreated, UTIs can lead to kidney infections. Early treatment is key.
